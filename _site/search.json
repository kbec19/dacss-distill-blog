This focus on the social psychology aspect of my work paired with a love for statistical and computational studies led me back to academia. After resuming courses at UMass Amherst, I decided in January 2022 to engage full-time in completing my Master’s degree in Data Analytics and Computation for Social Sciences.\r\n              My courses have developed and continue to grow my skills in qualitative and quantitative data analysis, survey methodology, research design, data visualization, and social psychology. I also continue to grow my proficiency in the programming languages R and Python. My primary academic research interests include combat veteran experiences and narratives, and their role in society, the intersecting study of veterans and environmental justice, and the prevention, onset, management, and resolution of conflict.\r\n              Next, I am looking for the right fit where I can use both my long-built and newfound knowledge and take on the new challenge of an internship in data science. I’m looking to connect with those pivoting to new phases in their educational and professional lives as well as those interested in engaging in building the support and knowledge resources of military veterans and their families, peacebuilding advocates, and anyone generally trying to find new ways to move the world forward.\r\n              My resume can be found here.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              After years of focus on operational management, I began researching new aspects of human resource analytics and pivoted my focus to executive HR management in 2020.
