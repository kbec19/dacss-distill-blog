In the 1960s, the Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and the Italian composer Ennio Morricone created a distinctive, sweeping vision of the Old West in movies like “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and “Once Upon a Time in the West,” where brass horns blew over desert sand. A couple decades later, they captured outlaws in more claustrophobic surroundings with “Once Upon a Time in America,” a mob movie set in New York’s Lower East Side. The plot tracks the growth of two gangsters (played as adults by Robert De Niro and James Woods) and a budding Broadway dancer (Elizabeth McGovern). It stretches over several decades — parts of the story take place in 1922, 1933 and 1968 — an epic expanse that was infamously cut to under two and a half hours when the film was shown in North American theaters. (“This version seems to have been edited with a roulette wheel,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times in 1984.)

This documentary, which was directed by the New York Times journalists Catrin Einhorn and Leslye Davis, has been 10 years in the making. Though much has been reported about the hardships some soldiers and their families face upon returning home from combat, this film focuses on one family and chronicles its changing dynamic. It begins in 2010, when Master Sgt. Brian Eisch, a single father, leaves two young sons for a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan. He then returns home following a serious injury, which requires his leg to be amputated below the knee. His experience at war and back at home — where he not only struggles physically, but with a loss of identity — ultimately affects what his sons hope for their own futures. “Life, in ‘Father Soldier Son’ does not move in a circle,\ Jessica Kiang wrote in her review for The New York Times", “but in an incrementally decaying orbit around the values that, in making us what we are," also keep us from being anything else.\""""","Stream a documentary about a family shaped by war, and catch a festival that celebrates all the ways dance can be represented onscreen.",Arts,Television,Culture,By Lauren Messman,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Father Soldier Son’ and the Dance on Camera Festival,What’s On Saturday,NA,News,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/arts/television/whats-on-tv-saturday-father-soldier-son-and-the-dance-on-camera-festival.html

But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.","His image is so commonplace that you could believe it must always have existed — yet for six centuries after his death, he was never once depicted in human form.",T Magazine,NA,TStyle,By Aatish Taseer,How the Buddha Got His Face,How the Buddha Got His Face,NA,News,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/t-magazine/buddha-statues-face.html,,,

10/6/2020,"An excerpt from “War: How Conflict Shaped Us,” by Margaret MacMillan","War. The word alone raises a range of emotions from horror to admiration. Some of us choose to avert our eyes as if the very act of remembering and thinking about war somehow brings it closer. Others of us are fascinated by it and can find in war excitement and glamour. As a historian I firmly believe that we have to include war in our study of human history if we are to make any sense of the past. War’s effects have been so profound that to leave it out is to ignore one of the great forces, along with geography, resources, economics, ideas, and social and political changes, which have shaped human development and changed history. If the Persians had defeated the Greek city-states in the fifth century b.c.; if the Incas had crushed Pizarro’s expedition in the sixteenth century; or if Hitler had won the Second World War, would the world have been different? We know that it would although we can only guess by how much.","An excerpt from “War: How Conflict Shaped Us,” by Margaret MacMillan",Books,Book Review,BookReview,NA,"‘War: How Conflict Shaped Us,’ by Margaret MacMillan: An Excerpt",NA,NA,Text,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/books/review/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan-an-excerpt.html,,,

This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.","Central Asia was once home to several bustling trade cities.

Now, an underused terrace on the 11th floor is being turned into an outdoor dining area, protected by red umbrellas, warmed with heaters and featuring a close-up view of the Empire State Building. It will serve cocktails and offer a dinner menu that’s an abridged version of the menu at Ai Fiori. The chef is Lauren DeSteno, the executive chef for Ai Fiori and a corporate executive chef for the Altamarea Group, where she oversees fine dining for restaurants including Ai Fiori and Marea. The chef Michael White, who was a founding partner of the restaurant group, is no longer involved with the company, according to Ahmass Fakahany, the founding partner who runs the company. Mr. White did not respond to inquiries from The Times. Now, Mr. Fakahany has been concentrating on promoting the women in his organization. “We have so much talent there,” he said. (In addition to Ms. DeSteno, Molly Nickerson has been the executive chef at Marea for the past two years, and Rachel Pancho is Ai Fiori’s pastry chef.) Osteria Morini and Nicoletta are the exceptions, in the hands of Bill Dorrler, also a corporate executive chef who oversees the many Morinis in the company’s portfolio. For the new terrace, Ms. DeSteno, 38, a Culinary Institute of America graduate who worked at Eleven Madison Park and has been with Altamarea for 12 years, has created a multilayered artichoke lasagna made with spinach pasta and a cloud of pecorino. She has not worked in Italy but has visited often. Her responsibilities with the company have also taken her to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere in the Middle East.

5/1/2021,A wealth of stores and studios in Connecticut and upstate New York offer lovely handmade wares that you’ll have forever.,"When I heard that Creel and Gow, the beloved cabinet of antique and handmade curiosities on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, just opened an outpost in Millbrook, N.Y., in order to have more space for its handcrafted furniture and textiles made by artisans in Morocco, where its owners, Jamie Creel and Marco Scarani, live for part of the year, it occurred to me that the area around Millbrook and in nearby Litchfield County, Conn., has become a mecca for craft. Not the chunky or cheeky minimalist Brooklynite-gone-upstate kind of craft, but the kind made by highly skilled longstanding practitioners, whose wares look most at home when paired with fine old patinated things. These sorts of history-friendly creations are the domain of people like Creel and Scarani — shopkeepers (and decorators and antiques dealers) who make keeping a shop seem like an art.",A wealth of stores and studios in Connecticut and upstate New York offer lovely handmade wares that you’ll have forever.,T Magazine,NA,TStyle,By Deborah Needleman,Looking for a Weekend Excursion?

Instead, they turned on her.","The regular conference meetings of the Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives, held most weeks behind closed doors in the Capitol Visitor Center, tend to be predictable and thus irregularly attended affairs. The party leaders — the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, the minority whip Steve Scalise and the conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, whose job it is to run these meetings — typically begin with a few housekeeping matters and then proceed with a discussion of the party’s message or issue du jour. The conference’s more voluble members line up at the microphone to opine for one to two minutes at a time; the rare newsworthy comment is often leaked and memorialized on Twitter seconds after it is uttered. An hour or so later, the members file out into the corridors of the Capitol and back to their offices, a few of them lingering to talk to reporters.","The Wyoming congresswoman challenged Republicans to turn away from Trump after Jan. 6.

The group collected furniture donations, bringing over sofas, tables and a bulky, outdated television. They also connected him to a hiring company, which landed him a job as a “picker” in an Amazon warehouse, a 12-mile drive from Corona in a town named Eastvale.

Although it was midafternoon, at some point she had dozed off on his bed. Now the door was closed, and her friend was groping her.
