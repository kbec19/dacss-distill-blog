Hi - Iâ€™m **Kristina**. I am a graduate student in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a M.S. in Data Analytics and Computation for Social Sciences.

This is my personal website which contains info about my research and where I blog about various topics of interest in the realm of social sciences and data analytics.

Please browse around, and feel free to leave a comment.
