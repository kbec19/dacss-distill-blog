518,"WE FLEW THROUGH the thin, light-suffused mist of a December afternoon in north India before landing among open fields outside the paramount site of Hindu pilgrimage: Varanasi, a temple town that curls around the Ganges, the equivalent of Rome or Jerusalem in the Hindu imagination. But the pilgrims on my flight from South Korea had an altogether different purpose. It was here, scarcely 15 miles from the airport, among fields now yellow with mustard flowers, that a renunciant prince had, upon gaining enlightenment some 25 centuries ago, given his first sermon, setting what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma into motion. At a deer park once called Isipatana, now Sarnath, a 35-year-old Gautama Buddha, hardly older than Christ when he climbed the hill of Calvary, revealed the eightfold path to liberation from suffering, his four noble truths and the doctrine of the impermanence of everything, including the Self. It was to the remains of the monastery and shrine at Sarnath that the pilgrims from East and Southeast Asia came, as pilgrims had for well over 1,500 years, along a subsidiary branch of the Great Silk Road, which ran through the high snowy mountains that girdle the Indian subcontinent into a riverine plain that stretches across what is today Pakistan and north India. The pilgrims took an exit off that highway of goods and ideas that ran from China to Rome in order to honor what may well have been the most influential doctrine to travel along its lines of transmission — the word of the Buddha, and the art made in his name.",5/11/2020,T Magazine,TStyle,By Aatish Taseer,How the Buddha Got His Face,How the Buddha Got His Face,News,,,

This city of 2.5 million had, in Soviet days, which lasted from the 1920s until the country’s independence in 1991, been the premier capital of Central Asia. It is home to more than half of Uzbekistan’s 116 universities, and on that first golden morning in Tashkent, there was something of the glazed perfection of a Soviet propaganda poster in the sight of students in twos and threes strolling down the runway-size avenues. They were dwarfed by the giant buildings that lined the roads — banks, museums and ministries — “Babylonian blocks,” as the English writer Philip Glazebrook, who had been in Tashkent at the end of Soviet rule, described them in “Journey to Khiva” in the early ’90s: “Since the days of Nineveh this has been the architecture of dictatorship and persecution.” And so it was, but after my late arrival on the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul, I found myself oddly in sympathy with the ideal, if not the reality, of Soviet life.",5/11/2020,T Magazine,TStyle,By Aatish Taseer,"In Uzbekistan, Coming to Terms With the Country’s Dazzling History",The Haunted Place,News,,,

719,"ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA (1984) Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In the 1960s, the Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and the Italian composer Ennio Morricone created a distinctive, sweeping vision of the Old West in movies like “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and “Once Upon a Time in the West,” where brass horns blew over desert sand. A couple decades later, they captured outlaws in more claustrophobic surroundings with “Once Upon a Time in America,” a mob movie set in New York’s Lower East Side. The plot tracks the growth of two gangsters (played as adults by Robert De Niro and James Woods) and a budding Broadway dancer (Elizabeth McGovern). It stretches over several decades — parts of the story take place in 1922, 1933 and 1968 — an epic expanse that was infamously cut to under two and a half hours when the film was shown in North American theaters. (“This version seems to have been edited with a roulette wheel,” Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times in 1984.)

As she made her way through crowds of men wearing masks, she became lightheaded, as if “the world was revolving around her head.” It was nothing like how she had imagined it. “When I was in prison, I thought the outside world is heaven and those who are released, they’re on their way to heaven,” she said. But now, finally experiencing it for herself, she found it alienating and even frightening. “I thought everyone was staring at me,” she said. “Pointing their fingers toward me while whispering, as if they knew I was a prisoner, but of course it was all in my head.”",7/14/2020,Magazine,Magazine,By Kiana Hayeri,She Went to Prison for Killing Her Husband.

Though much has been reported about the hardships some soldiers and their families face upon returning home from combat, this film focuses on one family and chronicles its changing dynamic. It begins in 2010, when Master Sgt. Brian Eisch, a single father, leaves two young sons for a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan. He then returns home following a serious injury, which requires his leg to be amputated below the knee. His experience at war and back at home — where he not only struggles physically, but with a loss of identity — ultimately affects what his sons hope for their own futures. “Life, in ‘Father Soldier Son’ does not move in a circle,\ Jessica Kiang wrote in her review for The New York Times",7/18/2020, in making us what we are,"Stream a documentary about a family shaped by war, and catch a festival that celebrates all the ways dance can be represented onscreen.",Arts,Television,Culture,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Father Soldier Son’ and the Dance on Camera Festival,,,

My preferred organization donates to local neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), but because of the coronavirus, hospitals aren’t taking blankets. The only places taking baby blankets are pregnancy clinics that are anti-abortion and associated with the Catholic Church or conservative Christian groups. I am not against donating to religious organizations, but I am staunchly pro-choice and believe women should not be judged or shamed for the difficult decisions they make regarding pregnancy. However, I worry that withholding my donation is further “punishing” any children whose parents have views that differ from my own, and I’m struggling with how to stay generous in spirit.
