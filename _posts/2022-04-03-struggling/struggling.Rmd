```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

It's not news to anyone that coding is difficult, and it's somewhat above and beyond my time constraints right now to learn more in order to build this blog. But I think (!) I **finally** got this thing going.

Thank you to [Steve Linberg](https://www.slinberg.net/){target="_blank"}. for your guidance getting the process of setting up a distill site through RStudio and for generally being a fabulous classmate!
