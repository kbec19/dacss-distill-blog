Hi! I’m **Kristina Becvar**, a graduate student in the [Department of
Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/){target="_blank"} at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){target="_blank"}. I’ve decided to start this blog to document my learning and development in data analysis.

It's not news to anyone that coding is difficult, and it's somewhat above and beyond my time constraints right now to learn more in order to build this blog. But I think (!) I **finally** got this thing going.

Thank you to [Steve Linberg](https://www.slinberg.net/){target="_blank"}. for your guidance getting the process of setting up a distill site through RStudio and for generally being a fabulous classmate!

Feel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me so that we can navigate some things together.
