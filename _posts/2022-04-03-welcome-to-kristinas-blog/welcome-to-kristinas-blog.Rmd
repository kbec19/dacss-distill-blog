## Welcome!

Hi! I’m **Kristina Becvar**, a graduate student in the [Department of
Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/){target="_blank"} at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){target="_blank"}.
I’ve decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in data analysis.

Feel free to pull up a chair, leave a comment, and join me so that we can navigate some things together.
